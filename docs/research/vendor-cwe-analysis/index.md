# Vendor-Specific Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) Analysis

!!! abstract "Research Overview"
    **Comparative Analysis of Vendor-Specific Common Weakness Enumeration Patterns: A Large-Scale Empirical Study**
    
    This research presents the first comprehensive, large-scale analysis of Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) distributions across five major technology vendors and platforms. Through analysis of 50,270 CVEs spanning 733 unique CWEs, we quantify vendor-specific vulnerability characteristics and establish statistical foundations for vendor-specific risk assessment.

## üßÆ Mathematical Framework

The research introduces novel quantitative metrics for vendor vulnerability assessment:

### Core Metrics

!!! formula "1. CWE Coverage Diversity"

    $$
    Coverage_{diversity}(V) = \frac{|CWE_{vendor}(V)|}{|CWE_{total}|} \times 100\%
    $$

    **Where**: $CWE_{vendor}(V)$ = unique CWEs for vendor V, $CWE_{total}$ = all CWEs in database

!!! formula "2. Specialization Index"

    $$
    Specialization(V) = \frac{CVE_{top1}(V)}{CVE_{total}(V)} \times 100\%
    $$

    **Where**: $CVE_{top1}(V)$ = count in most common CWE, $CVE_{total}(V)$ = total CVEs for vendor

!!! formula "3. Inequality Index (Gini Coefficient)"

    $$
    Gini(V) = \frac{2\sum(i \times CVE_{sorted}(i))}{n \times \sum CVE(i)} - \frac{n+1}{n}
    $$

    **Where**: $CVE_{sorted}(i)$ = i-th smallest CVE count, n = number of CWEs

!!! formula "4. Category Concentration"

    $$
    Concentration_{cat}(V) = \frac{\sum(CVE(c,V))}{CVE_{total}(V)} \times 100\%
    $$

    **Where**: $CVE(c,V)$ = CVEs in category c for vendor V
