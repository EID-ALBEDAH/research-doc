# Exploit Prediction Research

## Research Question
**Can we predict which CVEs are likely to be exploited based on their characteristics and temporal patterns?**

## Background & Motivation

The ability to predict which vulnerabilities will be exploited would enable:

 - **Proactive Security**: Organizations could prioritize patches before exploitation.
 - **Resource Allocation**: Security teams could focus on high-risk vulnerabilities.
 - **Threat Intelligence**: Enhanced understanding of attacker behavior patterns.

## Literature Foundation

Building on recent work:

- Jacobs et al. (2019) - EPSS scoring system
- Bullough et al. (2017) - Exploit prediction using machine learning
- Sabottke et al. (2015) - Vulnerability characteristics analysis

## Methodology Overview

### Phase 1: Feature Engineering
- **CVE Characteristics**: CVSS scores, CWE patterns, affected products
- **Temporal Features**: Time since disclosure, patch availability
- **Textual Features**: NLP analysis of vulnerability descriptions
- **Network Features**: Vendor ecosystem analysis

### Phase 2: Model Development
- **Baseline Models**: Logistic regression, random forest
- **Advanced Models**: XGBoost, neural networks
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple approaches

### Phase 3: Validation
- **Cross-validation**: Temporal splits to avoid data leakage
- **Performance Metrics**: Precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC
- **Comparative Analysis**: Against EPSS and other benchmarks

## Data Analysis Progress

### Current Status: <span class="status-indicator status-progress">In Progress</span>

!!! note "Latest Update"
    - Feature engineering notebook completed
    - Initial model training underway
    - Baseline results promising (AUC > 0.75)

### Key Findings So Far

1. **CWE Patterns**: Certain weakness types show higher exploitation rates
2. **Vendor Differences**: Exploitation patterns vary significantly by vendor
3. **Temporal Dynamics**: Time-to-exploit varies by vulnerability characteristics
