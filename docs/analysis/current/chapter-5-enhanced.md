# Chapter 5: Lifecycle Analysis (Enhanced Multi-Vendor)

## Overview

This chapter presents enhanced vulnerability lifecycle analysis building upon the transfer report foundation, now incorporating multi-vendor data and advanced statistical modeling techniques including survival analysis and temporal pattern recognition.

## **Data Preparation Notes:**

* **Date Filtering**: All queries implicitly filter date_published or release_date up to '2025-05-13'. You can adjust this date in Superset's time filter or directly in the SQL.  
* **Unnesting/Splitting**: For columns like cpes, vendors, and cwe_ids which are comma-separated strings, STRING_SPLIT_BY_REGEX is used to convert them into arrays, followed by UNNEST to expand them into separate rows for aggregation.  
* **Patch Data Unification**: For analyses requiring comprehensive patch data across vendors, a UNION ALL approach is used to combine msrc_patches, redhat_patches, cisco_patches, github_advisories, and morefixes_fixes.  
  * **Red Hat Filtering**: Remember to apply the specified Red Hat product filtering (product_name or product_id containing rh, red hat, red-hat, rhel, enterprise linux, baseos, appstream, openshift) for official Red Hat products. This is included in the Red Hat specific queries.  
  * **GitHub Advisories**: github_advisories is included where patched = 1 or patch_available = 1.  
  * **MoreFixes**: morefixes_fixes is joined with morefixes_commits to get the author_date as the patch date.

# **Comparative Analysis of Patching and Vulnerability Lifecycles: Commercial Vendors vs. Open Source**

This document provides SQL queries (DuckDB syntax) and Apache Superset configurations for a comparative analysis of patching and vulnerability lifecycle events across major commercial vendors (Microsoft, Red Hat, Cisco) and prominent open-source ecosystems (GitHub Advisories, MoreFixes). The analysis incorporates data up to May 13, 2025, and adheres to the specific filtering requirements for Red Hat products and the distinctions between commercial and open-source patch data.

## **Unified Patch Data Definition**

To facilitate comprehensive comparisons, the following Common Table Expression (CTE) named unified_patches combines patch information from all available sources, standardizing column names and introducing a vendor_source and patch_type to distinguish between commercial vendors and open-source projects. This CTE will be used as the foundation for subsequent queries.

```sql

* **Question Answered**: What are the most common weakness types addressed by patches from different commercial vendors and open-source projects?  
* **SQL Query**: (This query will show top CWEs for each vendor/source. You might need to create separate charts in Superset or use a filter for vendor_source.)  
```sql
  -- Requires the unified_patches CTE defined above  
  WITH unified_patches AS (  
      -- ... (Unified Patch Data CTE as defined in the introduction) ...  
  ),

* **Superset Configuration**:  
  * **X-axis**: patched_cve_count

  * **Sort By**: patched_cve_count (Descending)  
  * **Limit**: 10 (per vendor/source, handled by QUALIFY in SQL)

## **Time to Patch by Severity (Multi-Vendor/Source)**

* **Question Answered**: How does time to patch vary by severity across different commercial vendors and open-source projects?  
* **SQL Query**: (This query joins with cve_main to get severity and date_published for Time to Patch calculation. It uses cvss_v3_severity.)  
```sql

```

  * **Y-axis**: median_days_to_patch  
  * **Group By**: vendor_source  
  * **Sort By**: Custom order for severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

## **Exploit-Patch Gap (Multi-Vendor/Source)**

* **Question Answered**: What is the typical time gap between exploit publication and patch availability for different vendors and open-source projects?  
* **SQL Query**: (This query considers CVEs that have both an exploit and a patch. It uses the earliest exploit date from exploits table.)  
```sql
  -- Requires the unified_patches CTE defined above  
  WITH unified_patches AS (  
      -- ... (Unified Patch Data CTE as defined in the introduction) ...  
  )  
  SELECT  
      up.vendor_source,

  * **Sort By**: median_exploit_patch_gap (Ascending)  
  * **Chart Options**: Consider adding a reference line at 0 to clearly show positive/negative gaps.

## **Exploited vs. Non-Exploited Patching Time (Multi-Vendor/Source)**

* **Question Answered**: How does the time to patch differ for exploited versus non-exploited vulnerabilities across different vendors and open-source projects?  
* **SQL Query**: (This query joins unified_patches with cve_main to get has_exploit status and date_published for Time to Patch calculation.)  
```sql
