# Chapter 4: CVE Analysis (Enhanced Multi-Vendor)

## Overview

This chapter presents an enhanced reproduction of the CVE analysis from the transfer report, now expanded with multi-vendor data sources and updated through May 2025. The analysis maintains the original structure while adding comparative insights across commercial and open source ecosystems.

This document provides SQL queries (DuckDB syntax) and Apache Superset configuration details for visualizing your updated vulnerability, exploit, and patching data up to May 13, 2025.

## **Data Preparation Notes:**

* **Date Filtering**: All queries implicitly filter date_published or release_date up to '2025-05-13'. You can adjust this date in Superset's time filter or directly in the SQL.  
* **Unnesting/Splitting**: For columns like cpes, vendors, and cwe_ids which are comma-separated strings, STRING_SPLIT_BY_REGEX is used to convert them into arrays, followed by UNNEST to expand them into separate rows for aggregation.  
* **Patch Data Unification**: For analyses requiring comprehensive patch data across vendors, a UNION ALL approach is used to combine msrc_patches, redhat_patches, cisco_patches, github_advisories, and morefixes_fixes.  
  * **Red Hat Filtering**: Remember to apply the specified Red Hat product filtering (product_name or product_id containing rh, red hat, red-hat, rhel, enterprise linux, baseos, appstream, openshift) for official Red Hat products. This is included in the Red Hat specific queries.  
  * **GitHub Advisories**: github_advisories is included where patched = 1 or patch_available = 1.  
  * **MoreFixes**: morefixes_fixes is joined with morefixes_commits to get the author_date as the patch date.  
* **Severity Mapping**: CVSS v3 severity is used where available.
