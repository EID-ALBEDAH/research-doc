## Research Overview

In today's interconnected world, the security of information systems is of paramount importance. This research analyzes security vulnerabilities from all aspects as well as the lifecycle of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and their relationships with exploits, weaknesses (CWEs), and affected products (CPEs).

### Key Research Areas

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-security: **Vulnerability Lifecycle**

    Understanding the dynamics between discovery, exploitation, and patching of security vulnerabilities

- :material-chart-timeline-variant: **Temporal Analysis**

    Examining trends and patterns in the race between exploits and patches across different vendors

- :material-microsoft: :material-linux: **Multi-vendor Focus**

    Deep analysis of Microsoft, RedHat and Cisco vulnerabilities in addition to open-source with comprehensive patch and exploit correlation

- :material-brain: **Predictive Modeling**

    Machine learning approaches for exploit prediction and patch prioritization
