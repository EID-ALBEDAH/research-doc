# About This Research

## Researcher Profile

**Eid ALBADDAH**  
PhD Candidate in Cybersecurity  
City St George's, University of London  
Department of Computer Science

### Academic Journey

I am currently pursuing a **Doctor of Cybersecurity** degree, focusing on the complex dynamics of vulnerability lifecycles across modern software ecosystems. My research sits at the intersection of **security economics**, **data science**, and **empirical software engineering**, providing quantitative insights into how vulnerabilities are discovered, exploited, and patched across different vendor environments.

### Research Philosophy

My approach to cybersecurity research is fundamentally **data-driven** and **empirical**. Rather than relying solely on theoretical frameworks, I believe in extracting insights from real-world security data to understand the actual dynamics of vulnerability management. This methodology enables evidence-based recommendations for both defensive strategies and policy development.

## Research Evolution

### Phase 1: Foundation Building (2023-2024)
**Focus**: Establishing the Research Framework

During the initial phase of my PhD, I focused on building a solid foundation for vulnerability lifecycle analysis:

- **Literature Review**: Comprehensive analysis of existing security econometrics research, particularly building upon Stefan Frei's seminal 2009 work
- **Microsoft Ecosystem Focus**: Deep dive into Microsoft vulnerability patterns to establish baseline methodologies
- **Tool Development**: Creation of initial data collection and analysis frameworks
- **Transfer Report**: Successful completion demonstrating research viability and preliminary findings

**Key Milestone**: Transfer report approval, validating the research approach and establishing the foundation for expanded analysis.

### Phase 2: Expansion and Integration (2024-2025)
**Focus**: Multi-Vendor Ecosystem Analysis

The current phase represents a significant expansion in both scope and sophistication:

- **Data Integration**: Incorporation of multiple vendor sources (Microsoft, Red Hat, Cisco) and community datasets (GitHub, MoreFixes)
- **Methodological Enhancement**: Implementation of advanced statistical techniques including survival analysis and heavy-tailed distribution modeling
- **Temporal Extension**: Dataset expansion to include vulnerabilities through May 2025
- **Cross-Ecosystem Comparison**: Development of frameworks for comparing commercial vs. open source vulnerability management

**Current Status**: Active conference paper preparation and advanced modeling development.

### Phase 3: Advanced Modeling and Synthesis (2025-2027)
**Focus**: Predictive Frameworks and Thesis Completion

The final phase will focus on synthesizing insights into actionable frameworks:

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Development of exploit prediction and patch prioritization models
- **Policy Implications**: Translation of research findings into actionable security policy recommendations
- **Industry Validation**: Collaboration with industry partners to validate research findings
- **Thesis Completion**: Integration of all research components into a comprehensive thesis

## Core Research Questions

My research addresses several interconnected questions that are fundamental to modern cybersecurity:

### Primary Research Questions

1. **Lifecycle Dynamics**: How do vulnerability lifecycles differ across commercial and open source ecosystems, and what factors drive these differences?

2. **Temporal Patterns**: What patterns exist in the "race" between exploit development and patch deployment, and how have these patterns evolved over time?

3. **Predictive Capability**: Can we reliably predict which vulnerabilities will be exploited based on their characteristics, vendor ecosystem, and temporal context?

4. **Resource Optimization**: How should organizations prioritize patch deployment to maximize security impact given limited resources?

### Secondary Research Questions

1. **Weakness Evolution**: How do Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) patterns relate to exploitation likelihood and vendor response times?

2. **Vendor Comparison**: What systematic differences exist between vendor security response patterns, and what drives these differences?

3. **Economic Factors**: How do economic incentives influence vulnerability disclosure, exploitation, and patching behaviors?

4. **Policy Impact**: What policy interventions could improve the overall security ecosystem's response to vulnerabilities?

## Methodological Approach

### Data-Driven Foundation

My research is built on one of the most comprehensive vulnerability datasets assembled for academic research:

- **Scale**: 280K+ CVEs, 50K+ exploits, 75K+ patches across 26+ years
- **Diversity**: Multiple vendor ecosystems (commercial and open source)
- **Quality**: Rigorous validation and quality assurance procedures
- **Integration**: Systematic ETL processes ensuring data consistency

### Analytical Framework

I employ a **mixed-methods approach** combining:

**Quantitative Analysis**:
- Statistical modeling of temporal patterns
- Machine learning for prediction tasks
- Survival analysis for time-to-event modeling
- Heavy-tailed distribution analysis for security data

**Qualitative Analysis**:
- Case study analysis of significant vulnerabilities
- Vendor policy and procedure analysis
- Industry best practice evaluation

### Validation Strategy

Research validity is ensured through:
- **Temporal validation**: Time-series splits to prevent data leakage
- **Cross-vendor validation**: Consistency checks across different ecosystems
- **Industry feedback**: Validation with security practitioners
- **Peer review**: Conference and journal submission processes
