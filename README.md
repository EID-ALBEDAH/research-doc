# CVE Lifecycle Analysis Research Hub

> Analyzing CVE Lifecycle and Relationships with Exploits, Patches, CWEs, and CPEs

## Overview

This repository contains the documentation and research materials for CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) lifecycle analysis. The project explores the relationships between vulnerabilities, exploits, patches, and security frameworks.

## Features

- 📊 **Comprehensive Analysis**: CVE lifecycle patterns and temporal dynamics
- 🔍 **Multi-Vendor Research**: Comparative analysis across different vendors
- 🤖 **Machine Learning**: Exploit prediction and patch prioritization models
- 📚 **Interactive Documentation**: Built with MkDocs Material
- 🔬 **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive analysis and visualization

## Quick Start

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/EID-ALBEDAH/research-doc.git

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv mkdocs-env
source mkdocs-env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# mkdocs-env\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Serve documentation locally
mkdocs serve
```
